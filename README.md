# Audiobook-Analytics-Predictor

Audiobook Analytics Predictor is a machine learning project designed to analyze audiobook data and predict whether a customer will purchase again based on their past interactions and other relevant features. This repository implements a neural network-based classification model using Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
- Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on audiobook data to uncover valuable insights that drive customer behavior predictions.
- Machine Learning Pipeline: Implement a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training, validation, and evaluation, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.
- Neural Networks: Build and train neural network models using TensorFlow, featuring multi-layer architectures and techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.
